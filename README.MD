# Avalon Package Manager

My package manager that installs github repos.
It is meant to be used to compile and install compiled programs but it works with interpreted languages too.

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/R2Boyo25/AvalonPackageManager
cd AvalonPackageManager
python3 install.py
cd ..
rm -rf AvalonPackageManager
```
